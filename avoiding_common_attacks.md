As I have based the underlying contracts on the battle tested open zeppelin suite - I benefit from the battle tested architecture.

The smart contracts employ the SafeMath library in handling balance transactions. This is to avoid integer overflow/underflow scenarios that plagued early ICO smart contracts.

Another reason why the zeppelin contracts are trusted is because of the consistent use of reentrancy resistant code.
